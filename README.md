# bb: the awk build system

> Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn‚Äôt stop to think if they should.

# ABOUT

`bb` demonstrates a working build system written in GNU awk, to organize build steps for awk projects.

# EXAMPLE

```console
$ cd example

$ ./bb
bzz bzz

$ ./bb help
Usage: bb [<task> [<task> [<task> ...]]]

Tasks:

* all
* help
* test
```

# CONFIGURATION

Tasks are implemented with awk functions.

Task trees are implemented with functions that call other functions.

That's it.

# REQUIREMENTS

* a UNIX environment with [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) / [base](http://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/) / [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos) / [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) / etc.
* GNU [awk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html) v5+
